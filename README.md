# Sensors Data Visualization
<p>
This application provides graphical representation of data which is gathered through sensors and OpenWeatherMap API. This includes data about temperature, air humidity, brightness and smoke density. Data is measured through time and represented as lowest, average and highest value for all 4 measured factors. Devices used for getting data from sensors are arduino and raspberryPi, while grafana is used for creating graphs. Application is realised in python and c++.
